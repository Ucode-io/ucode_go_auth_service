    properties:
      body:
        description: |-
          Body is the request's body.

          For client requests, a nil body means the request has no
          body, such as a GET request. The HTTP Client's Transport
          is responsible for calling the Close method.

          For server requests, the Request Body is always non-nil
          but will return EOF immediately when no body is present.
          The Server will close the request body. The ServeHTTP
          Handler does not need to.

          Body must allow Read to be called concurrently with Close.
          In particular, calling Close should unblock a Read waiting
          for input.
      cancel:
        description: |-
          Cancel is an optional channel whose closure indicates that the client
          request should be regarded as canceled. Not all implementations of
          RoundTripper may support Cancel.

          For server requests, this field is not applicable.

          Deprecated: Set the Request's context with NewRequestWithContext
          instead. If a Request's Cancel field and context are both
          set, it is undefined whether Cancel is respected.
        type: object
      close:
        description: |-
          Close indicates whether to close the connection after
          replying to this request (for servers) or after sending this
          request and reading its response (for clients).

          For server requests, the HTTP server handles this automatically
          and this field is not needed by Handlers.

          For client requests, setting this field prevents re-use of
          TCP connections between requests to the same hosts, as if
          Transport.DisableKeepAlives were set.
        type: boolean
      contentLength:
        description: |-
          ContentLength records the length of the associated content.
          The value -1 indicates that the length is unknown.
          Values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
          be read from Body.

          For client requests, a value of 0 with a non-nil Body is
          also treated as unknown.
        type: integer
      form:
        allOf:
        - $ref: '#/definitions/url.Values'
        description: |-
          Form contains the parsed form data, including both the URL
          field's query parameters and the PATCH, POST, or PUT form data.
          This field is only available after ParseForm is called.
          The HTTP client ignores Form and uses Body instead.
      header:
        allOf:
        - $ref: '#/definitions/http.Header'
        description: "Header contains the request header fields either received\nby
          the server or to be sent by the client.\n\nIf a server received a request
          with header lines,\n\n\tHost: example.com\n\taccept-encoding: gzip, deflate\n\tAccept-Language:
          en-us\n\tfOO: Bar\n\tfoo: two\n\nthen\n\n\tHeader = map[string][]string{\n\t\t\"Accept-Encoding\":

          {\"Bar\", \"two\"},\n\t}\n\nFor incoming requests, the Host header is promoted
          to the\nRequest.Host field and removed from the Header map.\n\nHTTP defines
          that header names are case-insensitive. The\nrequest parser implements this
          by using CanonicalHeaderKey,\nmaking the first character and any characters
          following a\nhyphen uppercase and the rest lowercase.\n\nFor client requests,
          certain headers such as Content-Length\nand Connection are automatically
          written when needed and\nvalues in Header may be ignored. See the documentation\nfor
          the Request.Write method."
      host:
        description: |-
          For server requests, Host specifies the host on which the
          URL is sought. For HTTP/1 (per RFC 7230, section 5.4), this
          is either the value of the "Host" header or the host name
          given in the URL itself. For HTTP/2, it is the value of the
          ":authority" pseudo-header field.
          It may be of the form "host:port". For international domain
          names, Host may be in Punycode or Unicode form. Use
          golang.org/x/net/idna to convert it to either format if
          needed.
          To prevent DNS rebinding attacks, server Handlers should
          validate that the Host header has a value for which the
          Handler considers itself authoritative. The included
          ServeMux supports patterns registered to particular host
          names and thus protects its registered Handlers.

          For client requests, Host optionally overrides the Host
          header to send. If empty, the Request.Write method uses
          the value of URL.Host. Host may contain an international
          domain name.
        type: string
      method:
        description: |-
          Method specifies the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
          For client requests, an empty string means GET.

          Go's HTTP client does not support sending a request with
          the CONNECT method. See the documentation on Transport for
          details.

          MultipartForm is the parsed multipart form, including file uploads.
          This field is only available after ParseMultipartForm is called.
          The HTTP client ignores MultipartForm and uses Body instead.
      postForm:
        allOf:
        - $ref: '#/definitions/url.Values'
        description: |-
          PostForm contains the parsed form data from PATCH, POST
          or PUT body parameters.

          This field is only available after ParseForm is called.
          The HTTP client ignores PostForm and uses Body instead.
      proto:
        description: |-
          The protocol version for incoming server requests.

          For client requests, these fields are ignored. The HTTP
          client code always uses either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.
          See the docs on Transport for details.

      remoteAddr:

          RemoteAddr allows HTTP servers and other software to record
          the network address that sent the request, usually for
          logging. This field is not filled in by ReadRequest and
          has no defined format. The HTTP server in this package
          sets RemoteAddr to an "IP:port" address before invoking a
          handler.
          This field is ignored by the HTTP client.
        type: string
      requestURI:
        description: |-
          RequestURI is the unmodified request-target of the
          Request-Line (RFC 7230, Section 3.1.1) as sent by the client
          to a server. Usually the URL field should be used instead.
          It is an error to set this field in an HTTP client request.

        allOf:

          Response is the redirect response which caused this request
          to be created. This field is only populated during client
          redirects.
      tls:
        allOf:
        - $ref: '#/definitions/tls.ConnectionState'
        description: |-
          TLS allows HTTP servers and other software to record
          information about the TLS connection on which the request
          was received. This field is not filled in by ReadRequest.
          The HTTP server in this package sets the field for
          TLS-enabled connections before invoking a handler;
          otherwise it leaves the field nil.
          This field is ignored by the HTTP client.
      trailer:
        allOf:
        - $ref: '#/definitions/http.Header'
        description: |-
          Trailer specifies additional headers that are sent after the request
          body.

          For server requests, the Trailer map initially contains only the
          trailer keys, with nil values. (The client declares which trailers it
          will later send.)  While the handler is reading from Body, it must
          not reference Trailer. After reading from Body returns EOF, Trailer
          can be read again and will contain non-nil values, if they were sent
          by the client.

          For client requests, Trailer must be initialized to a map containing
          the trailer keys to later send. The values may be nil or their final
          values. The ContentLength must be 0 or -1, to send a chunked request.
          After the HTTP request is sent the map values can be updated while
          the request body is read. Once the body returns EOF, the caller must
          not mutate Trailer.

          Few HTTP clients, servers, or proxies support HTTP trailers.
      transferEncoding:
        description: |-
          TransferEncoding lists the transfer encodings from outermost to
          innermost. An empty list denotes the "identity" encoding.
          TransferEncoding can usually be ignored; chunked encoding is
          automatically added and removed as necessary when sending and
          receiving requests.
        items:
          type: string
        type: array
      url:
        allOf:
        - $ref: '#/definitions/url.URL'
        description: |-
          URL specifies either the URI being requested (for server
          requests) or the URL to access (for client requests).

          For server requests, the URL is parsed from the URI
          supplied on the Request-Line as stored in RequestURI.  For
          most requests, fields other than Path and RawQuery will be
          empty. (See RFC 7230, Section 5.3)

          For client requests, the URL's Host specifies the server to
          connect to, while the Request's Host field optionally
          specifies the Host header value to send in the HTTP
          request.
    type: object
  http.Response:
    properties:
      body:
        description: |-
          Body represents the response body.

          The response body is streamed on demand as the Body field
          is read. If the network connection fails or the server
          terminates the response, Body.Read calls return an error.

          The http Client and Transport guarantee that Body is always
          non-nil, even on responses without a body or responses with
          a zero-length body. It is the caller's responsibility to
          close Body. The default HTTP client's Transport may not
          reuse HTTP/1.x "keep-alive" TCP connections if the Body is
          not read to completion and closed.

          The Body is automatically dechunked if the server replied
          with a "chunked" Transfer-Encoding.

          As of Go 1.12, the Body will also implement io.Writer
          on a successful "101 Switching Protocols" response,
          as used by WebSockets and HTTP/2's "h2c" mode.
      close:
        description: |-
          Close records whether the header directed that the connection be
          closed after reading Body. The value is advice for clients: neither
          ReadResponse nor Response.Write ever closes a connection.
        type: boolean
      contentLength:
        description: |-
          ContentLength records the length of the associated content. The
          value -1 indicates that the length is unknown. Unless Request.Method
          is "HEAD", values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
          be read from Body.
        type: integer
      header:
        allOf:
        - $ref: '#/definitions/http.Header'
        description: |-
          Header maps header keys to values. If the response had multiple
          headers with the same key, they may be concatenated, with comma
          delimiters.  (RFC 7230, section 3.2.2 requires that multiple headers
          be semantically equivalent to a comma-delimited sequence.) When
          Header values are duplicated by other fields in this struct (e.g.,
          ContentLength, TransferEncoding, Trailer), the field values are
          authoritative.

          Keys in the map are canonicalized (see CanonicalHeaderKey).

          The Trailer initially contains only nil values, one for
          each key specified in the server's "Trailer" header
          value. Those values are not added to Header.

          Trailer must not be accessed concurrently with Read calls
          on the Body.

          After Body.Read has returned io.EOF, Trailer will contain
          any trailer values sent by the server.
      transferEncoding:

          Body yields the uncompressed content instead of the compressed
          content actually set from the server, ContentLength is set to -1,
          and the "Content-Length" and "Content-Encoding" fields are deleted
          from the responseHeader. To get the original response from
          the server, set Transport.DisableCompression to true.

          When parsing a certificate, a positive non-zero MaxPathLen
          means that the field was specified, -1 means it was unset,
          and MaxPathLenZero being true mean that the field was
          explicitly set to zero. The case of MaxPathLen==0 with MaxPathLenZero==false
          should be treated equivalent to -1 (unset).

          When generating a certificate, an unset pathLenConstraint
          can be requested with either MaxPathLen == -1 or using the
          zero value for both MaxPathLen and MaxPathLenZero.
        type: integer
      maxPathLenZero:
        description: |-
          MaxPathLenZero indicates that BasicConstraintsValid==true
          and MaxPathLen==0 should be interpreted as an actual
          maximum path length of zero. Otherwise, that combination is
          interpreted as MaxPathLen not being set.
